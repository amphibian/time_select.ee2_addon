**Time Select** is an EE2 fieldtype that offers a configurable dropdown menu of times. Its intended use is for events channels.

## Usage

After installing and activating Time Select, choose it as your fieldtype in either a custom field or Matrix field. You have two configuration options for each Time Select field:

* **Display Style**: whether to show the time in 12-hour or 24-hour format on the publish screen.
* **Time Increments**: you can choose to have the time options increment by 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 1 hour.

## Template Tags

When displaying your field within your templates, you can format the output using [standard EE date formatting tokens](http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/templates/date_variable_formatting.html). If you don't format your field output, the time's value in seconds will be displayed.

Example:

`{my_time_field format="%g:%i%a"}`

This yields **7:00pm**.

*Time Select has been tested with ExpressionEngine 2.1.3, and is compatible with Matrix fields.*


## Datagrab Export / import
if you want to export / import the fieldtype to another website, export it with format=%H:%i, (23:59). The accompanying datagrab type will parse and split the field on the : (colon) so that you'll be able to import it on the dev/staging server.
